# Securing a Business Network

## Project Overview
The "Securing a Business Network" project focuses on developing a robust security framework to protect a business's network infrastructure. This project involves assessing the current network setup, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing security measures to safeguard sensitive data and ensure compliance with industry standards. The goal is to create a secure environment that supports business operations while minimizing risks.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project include:
- Assessing the existing network architecture and identifying vulnerabilities.
- Implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor and control network traffic.
- Establishing secure remote access solutions for employees.
- Recommending best practices for network security policies and procedures.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/slakshya2/Securing-a-Business-Network.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd Securing-a-Business-Network

## Usage
This project includes various scripts and documentation to assist in securing the business network. Follow the instructions in the respective scripts to implement security measures, configure firewalls, and analyze network traffic.

Key Steps in the Project:
- Network Assessment: Conduct a thorough assessment of the existing network architecture to identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.
- Firewall Configuration: Implement and configure firewalls to control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Set up an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats.
- Secure Remote Access: Establish secure VPN connections for remote employees to access the network safely.
- Policy Development: Create and recommend network security policies and procedures to guide employees in maintaining a secure environment.

## Network Architecture
The network architecture consists of the following components:
- Firewalls: Placed at the network perimeter to filter traffic and protect against unauthorized access.
- IDS: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators to potential threats.
- VPN Gateway: Provides secure remote access for employees working from outside the office.
- Internal Servers: Hosts critical business applications and sensitive data, requiring strict access controls.

## Findings and Recommendations
Throughout the project, several key findings were identified, including:

- Vulnerabilities: Identified weaknesses in the current network configuration that could be exploited by attackers.
- Firewall Rules: Recommended specific firewall rules to enhance network security, including blocking unnecessary ports and protocols.
- Employee Training: Suggested regular training sessions for employees on best practices for network security and phishing awareness.
For detailed findings and specific recommendations, please refer to the reports included in the reports/ directory.

## Automation Opportunities
The following areas were identified for potential automation within the business network:

- Network Monitoring: Automate the monitoring of network traffic to detect anomalies and alert administrators in real-time.
- Patch Management: Develop a script to automate the deployment of security patches to network devices and servers.
- User Access Management: Implement automated user provisioning and de-provisioning processes to manage employee access to network resources efficiently.
